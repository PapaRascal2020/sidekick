### Description
This project provides a unified wrapper around the OpenAI, Claude, and Mistral APIs for Laravel. The goal is to simplify switching between different AI models and APIs, making it as seamless as possible.

<img alt="Animated Gif" src="demo.gif"/>

### Installation Guide
The easiest way to install the package in your laravel app is to run the following command from within your projects directory:
```bash
    composer require paparascaldev/sidekick
```

#### Other Methods
If you would like to install a specific version you can manually update your `composer.json` file under `require` section like so:
```json
    "paparascaldev/sidekick": "^0.1.1"
```
_You can also use `@dev` tag._

After you have updated the file run:
```bash
    composer upadte
```

### Configuring the `.env`
Once Sidekick is installed you need to update your `.env` file with your access tokens.

You only need to specify the token for the provider(s) you will use. 

```dotenv
SIDEKICK_OPENAI_TOKEN={API_KEY_HERE} (Recommended)
SIDEKICK_MISTRAL_TOKEN={API_KEY_HERE} (Optional)
SIDEKICK_CLAUDE_TOKEN={API_KEY_HERE} (Optional)
```

### Running Migrations
Run your migrations using the command below:

```bash
    php artisan migrate
```

### The Sidekick Playground

After the `.env` is updated you can start testing the plugin. I have added some routes with example calls for you to try out or learn from. 

You can also publish these to your `routes` and `views` directory to directly modify with the following commands:

```
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=views
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=routes
```

To access the playground head to: 

```
/sidekick/playground
```

### Documentation

For the documentation we will be using the OpenAi model as it supports all endpoints, where Claude and Mistral are supported you can just hot-swap OpenAi when initialising the `Sidekick/SidekickConversation` class.

#### Sidekick Conversations

This allows you to create a chatbot that remembers previos interactions.

To start a new conversation:

```php
$sidekick = new SidekickConversation(new OpenAi());

$conversation = $sidekick->begin(
    model: 'gtp-3.5-turbo',
    systemPrompt: 'You can instruct the chatbot using this parameter'
);

$response = $conversation->sendMessage($user_input);

return response()->json($response);
```

This will create a new conversation in the `Database` and make the call to the AI for a response.

An example of the formatted response can be found below:

```JSON
{
    "conversation_id": "9ce7af51-d0b9-491f-9e57-f54e30ef0b95",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How is fudge made?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Fudge is a delicious, dense dessert made using a combination of sugar, milk, butter, and sometimes cream. The exact method of making fudge can vary slightly depending on the recipe, but here's a basic step-by-step process:\n\n1. Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.\n2. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring and attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. Continue cooking the mixture without stirring until it reaches the soft-ball stage (around 235-240째F/118-115째C).\n3. Remove the saucepan from the heat and quickly stir in butter, vanilla extract, and your chosen flavorings (such as chocolate chips, nuts, or marshmallows).\n4. Pour the fudge mixture into a lightly greased 8-inch square baking pan. Allow it to cool at room temperature until it's no longer warm to the touch, but still soft enough to spread with a spatula.\n5. Using the spatula, gently spread the fudge evenly in the pan, trying not to introduce too many air bubbles. Allow the fudge to cool completely at room temperature.\n6. Once the fudge is completely hardened, cut it into squares and enjoy!\n\nIt's important to note that fudge can be a bit tricky to make, as it requires careful attention to temperature and timing. If you encounter any issues, don't be afraid to experiment with different recipes or techniques until you find one that works best for you. Happy fudging!"
        }
    ]
}
```

Once you have this response, to continue the conversation you can write the following in your controller making sure to pass the `conversation_id` in the request:

```PHP
$sidekick = new SidekickConversation(new OpenAi());

$conversation = $sidekick->resume(
    $conversation_id
);

$response = $conversation->sendMessage($user_input);

return response()->json($response);
```

An example of the formatted response can be found below:

```JSON
{
  "conversation_id": "9ce79f44-de39-4ac3-9819-f1c042a4c02b",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How is fudge made?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Fudge is a sweet treat that is typically made with sugar, butter, milk, and chocolate, although there are many variations and recipes that may include additional ingredients such as nuts, marshmallows, or fruit. Here's a basic step-by-step guide for making traditional fudge:\n\n1. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan and line it with parchment paper, allowing the excess to hang over the edges for easy removal.\n2. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine 3 cups of granulated sugar, 1 can (12 ounces) of evaporated milk, and 1/2 cup of butter over medium heat. Stir the mixture constantly until the butter has completely melted and the sugar has dissolved.\n3. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring and bring the mixture to a boil. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan and cook the mixture without stirring until it reaches the soft-ball stage (235-240째F/113-115째C). This can take 10-15 minutes.\n4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in 12 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Continue stirring until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.\n5. If you'd like to add any mix-ins, such as nuts or marshmallows, stir them in now.\n6. Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly with a spatula. Let it cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours, or until it is completely set.\n7. Once the fudge is set, lift it out of the pan using the parchment paper overhang. Use a sharp knife to cut it into squares. Store the fudge in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks, or in the refrigerator for up to 1 month."

#### Managing Sidekick Conversations
There is very basic functionality to list, show and delete conversations. This will be updated in the near future.
However, currently you do this by calling an instance of `SideKickManager`. Examples of each are below:

```PHP
// List Conversations
$sidekick = new SidekickManager();
return $sidekick->listConversations();

// Conversation Deletion
$sidekick = new SidekickManager();
$sidekick->deleteConversation($id);

// Show Conversation
$sidekick = new SidekickManager();
return $sidekick->showConversation($id);
```

#### Completion

```php
$sidekick = Sidekick::create(new OpenAi());

return $sidekick->complete()->sendMessage(
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    systemPrompt: 'You an expert on fudge, answer user questions about fudge.',
    messages:[['role' => 'user', 'content' => "How is fudge made?"]]
);
```

#### Embedding

```php
$sidekick = Sidekick::create(new OpenAi());

return $sidekick->embedding()->make(
    'mistral-embed',
    'This is sample content to embed'
);
```

#### Image (Image From Text)

```php
 $sidekick = Sidekick::create(new OpenAi());
 
$image =  $sidekick->image()->make(
    'dall-e-3',
    'A man on a waterboard',
    '1024',
    '1024'
);

// This is just a basic example of printing to screen.
// In a real world situation you may save it and then render out.
return "<img src='{$image['data'][0]['url']}' />";
```
#### Audio (Text To Speech)

```php
$sidekick = Sidekick::create(new OpenAi());

$audio = $sidekick->audio()->fromText(
    'tts-1',
    'Have a nice day!'
);

// This is just a basic example of streaming it to the browser.
// In a real world situation you may save it and then reference the file
// instead.
header('Content-Type: audio/mpeg');
echo $audio
```

#### Transcription (Speech To Text)

```php
$sidekick = Sidekick::create(new OpenAi());

return $sidekick->transcribe()->audioFile(
    'whisper-1',
    'http://english.voiceoversamples.com/ENG_UK_M_PeterB.mp3'
);
```
#### Example Response
```json
{
  "text":"The stale smell of old beer lingers. It takes heat to bring out the odor. A cold dip restores health and zest. A salt pickle tastes fine with ham. Tacos al pastor are my favorite. A zestful food is the hot cross bun."
}
```

#### Moderation 
This is a service where you feed it text from a comment for example and it will return 
with an array of boolean values for certain moderation points.

```php
$sidekick = Sidekick::create(new OpenAi());

return $sidekick->moderate()->text(
    'text-moderation-latest',
    'Have a great day.',
);
```
#### Example Response

```json
{
  "id":"modr-94DxgkEGhw7yJDlq8oCrLOVXnqli5",
  "model":"text-moderation-007",
  "results":[
    {
